PLEASE READ THIS UPDATE:

Original Fair Launch Date on PancakeSwap was April 20.

It has now been delayed to April 25, 2021 12:01 Eastern Time (America), in order to:

• Mainnet the Smart Contract (Update: LIVE NOW. See contract addres and BSCSca link below)

• Officially sign a Chief Compliance Officer for HUP.LIFE (yay, a new team member!)

• Ensure all initial launch marketing aspects are prepared ahead of that date.


The token address is 0xb27e2b29Aa406749Ddeb0741BA189751f83701c0.
